index.html will be in the root of the directory

all the css files will be inside ./src/css/<name>.css and will be imported in the header of index.html
all the javascript files will be inside ./src/css/<name>.js and will be imported at the end of the body
the code should be clearly formatted(use something like prettier) and should be conventionally named
all the styling will be done by classes and not BY ID
ID will only be used as a reference for DOM objects in JS
dont make unnessecary subfiles in ./src/
